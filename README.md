# MAE 4060/5065: Introduction to Spaceflight Mechanics

This is a collection of functions, scripts, and notebooks (mostly in MATLAB) used in lectures and to produce course materials for Cornell MAE 4060/5065.  Comments, questions, and pull requests are welcome. Most functions and scripts are standalone, but multiple have dependencies in the util directory. 

Other useful MATLAB codes can be found in: https://github.com/dsavransky/MAE2030 (in particular in the Ch10 and Ch11 folders) and in https://github.com/dsavransky/MAE6720 

MATLAB code was all written/tested in various versions up to R2021a, but should (mostly) work in any version after R2014b.  Some plot commands may not work in earlier releases. MATLAB live scripts (in the Notebooks directory) may not work properly in any version older than 2019a.

For static views of the Jupyter Notebooks go to https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dsavransky/MAE4060/tree/main/Notebooks/
These notebooks have been tested in Python 3.7-3.8 and use Sympy >= 1.0.  They also use sympyhelpers.py from my miscpy package (https://github.com/dsavransky/miscpy).
