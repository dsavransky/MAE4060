# MAE4060
Code for Cornell MAE4060 - Introduction to Spaceflight Mechanics

This is a collection of routines (mostly in MATLAB) used in lectures for Cornell MAE 4060.  Comments, questions, and pull requests welcome.

MATLAB code was all written/tested in R2016a, but should work in any version after R2014b.  Some plot commands may not work in earlier releases.
