# MAE4060
Code for Cornell MAE4060 - Introduction to Spaceflight Mechanics

This is a collection of routines (mostly in MATLAB) used in lectures for Cornell MAE 4060.  Comments, questions, and pull requests welcome.

MATLAB code was all written/tested in R2016a, but should work in any version after R2014b.  Some plot commands may not work in earlier releases.

For static views of the Jupyter Notebooks go to http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dsavransky/MAE4060/blob/master/Notebooks/
These notebooks are written in Python 2.7.12 and use Sympy 1.0.  They also use sympyhelpers.py from https://github.com/dsavransky/miscpy/blob/master/utils/sympyhelpers.py
