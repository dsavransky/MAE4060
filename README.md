# MAE4060
Code for Cornell MAE4060 - Introduction to Spaceflight Mechanics

This is a collection of routines (mostly in MATLAB) used in lectures for Cornell MAE 4060.  Comments, questions, and pull requests welcome.

Other useful MATLAB codes can be found in: https://github.com/dsavransky/MAE2030 (in particular in the Ch10 and Ch11 folders).

MATLAB code was all written/tested in various versions up to R2018b, but should (mostly) work in any version after R2014b.  Some plot commands may not work in earlier releases.

For static views of the Jupyter Notebooks go to http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dsavransky/MAE4060/blob/master/Notebooks/
These notebooks are written in Python 2.7 and 3.7 and use Sympy 1.0.  They also use sympyhelpers.py from https://github.com/dsavransky/miscpy/blob/master/utils/sympyhelpers.py

The Handouts directory contains lecture slide Handouts that accompany the course.  Please note that the handouts are *not* the lectures and do not provide the entirety of the content of the lectures.
